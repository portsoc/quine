# Quine Challenge

## Background

Willard van Orman Quine was a 20th century American Philosopher who influenced Douglas Hofstadter's fascinating work on the relationship between music, mathematics, and art.  Hofstadter's subsequent [book on the subject](http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=cat01619a&AN=up.655578&site=eds-live) in turn gives us the concept of _a quine_, which is:

 * A computer program whose purpose is to output its own source code.

For example, here is a purposefully simple _quine_ for nodejs.


```javascript
function f(f) {
  console.log(f.toString());
  console.log("f(f);");
}
f(f);
```

Seventy-six characters of self-replication.  We can shrink this down using a few techniques that should be familiar to most JS programmers.  This one-line version is just forty-three characters.

```javascript
f=() => console.log("f=" + f + ";f()");f()
```

It's possible to go shorter than this even, but the _quines_ get less readable and require significantly more cognitive investment, and our point here is to show the basic idea.  We leave these shorter node _quines_ for your future investigation because we have a different challenge for you…

## Task

We wish for you to attempt to write a web page whose output is its own source code: a _web-quine_.

We seek answers to the following questions:
1. What is the shortest _web-quine_?
2. What is the shortest _**valid** web-quine_?

### Rules
1. The page should be testable thus:
  1. Copy the quine output and save it to a file.
  2. Compare the output file with the source file: it should be a byte-for-byte replica of the source.
2. You may use HTML, CSS and JS as necessary.
3. All code must be part of a single self-replicating HTML file.
4. Check pages for validity using the [W3C's online validation service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).  Warnings are permissible, but the document must contain no errors.

### Steps


1. Fork this repo in Github.
2. Clone it using git:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_id>/quine.git
```
2. Edit `quine/index.html` until its output is the same as its source.
3. …then improve it.
4. Share:
  * Store your solutions in the `solutions` folder (we suggest your surname and the character length of the file in characters, similar to what we've done in the examples folder).
  * Push your repo back up to Github.
  * Send us a _Pull request_ through Github.
  * We will then incorporate your solutions into our repository.
